In Python, everything is an object. An object is a data structure that contains data, known as attributes, and methods,
which are functions that operate on that data. Here are some examples of objects in Python:

Integer Object: An integer is an object in Python that represents a whole number.


x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>


String Object: A string is an object in Python that represents a sequence of characters.

s = "Hello, World!"
print(type(s))  # Output: <class 'str'>


List Object: A list is an object in Python that represents an ordered collection of items.

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(type(lst))  # Output: <class 'list'>


Tuple Object: A tuple is an object in Python that represents an ordered, immutable collection of items.


t = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(type(t))  # Output: <class 'tuple'>


Dictionary Object: A dictionary is an object in Python that represents a collection of key-value pairs.



d = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(type(d))  # Output: <class 'dict'>


Function Object: A function is an object in Python that represents a block of code that can be called and executed.


  def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
    
print(type(say_hello))  # Output: <class 'function'>




In summary, everything in Python is an object with its own type and attributes. This makes Python a powerful and flexible programming language.

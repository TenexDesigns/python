Obeject oriented programming involves working with classes:
  
  
  
  Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it allows you to create and manipulate objects, which are instances of classes.
  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects and their interactions to solve problems.

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
You can define a class in Python using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class and a colon. Heres an example:



class Dog:
                 #We have to include this self in all methods of a class
    def __init__(self, name, breed):  # This is like the constructor. It is initialized every time  the  classs object is created 
        self.name = name              # Here we create a constructor that receives two parameters name and breed. We assigne this received parameters 
        self.breed = breed            # To the class by using self.name = name that was received

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Rufus", "Golden Retriever")
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Rufus
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Woof!



In this example, we define a Dog class that has two attributes (name and breed) and one method (bark).
The __init__ method is a special method that is called when a new object is created.
It initializes the attributes of the object with the values passed to the constructor.

We create a new Dog object called my_dog, passing in the name "Rufus" and the breed "Golden Retriever".
We then print the value of the name attribute of my_dog and call its bark method.

Object-oriented programming allows you to organize your code into reusable and modular components, making it easier to maintain and extend.
It also provides a way to model real-world objects and their interactions in a natural and intuitive way.

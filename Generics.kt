     generic =  "not specific to a particular data type"
                 add <T> to: classes, methods, fields, etc. to make them generic or "not specific to any data type"
                 We can add <T> or anything taht starts with T,  e.g <Thing>, <That>, but it is common convention that we use <T>
                 Generics allows for code reusability for different data types




using System;

namespace MyFirstProgram
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {


            int[] intArray = { 1, 2, 3 };
            double[] doubleArray = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 };
            String[] stringArray = { "1", "2", "3" };

            displayElements(intArray);            /Here we can iterate over arrays of different data types becuse of using generics
            displayElements(doubleArray);
            displayElements(stringArray);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }     
        public static void displayElements<Thing>(Thing[] array)            So this method can receive an array of any dat type
        {
            foreach (Thing item in array)
            {
                Console.Write(item + " ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}

  What are generics in C#?
Generics are a feature of C# that allow you to create classes, methods, and interfaces that can work with any type of data.
This is done by using a placeholder type parameter, which is replaced with the actual type when the generic class or method is instantiated.

How to create generics in C#
To create a generic class, you use the following syntax:

Code snippet
class MyGenericClass<T>
{
    // ...
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
The T in this example is the type parameter. You can use any name you want for the type parameter.

To create a generic method, you use the following syntax:

Code snippet
public T MyGenericMethod<T>(T value)
{
    // ...
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
The T in this example is the type parameter. You can use any name you want for the type parameter.

How to use generics in C#
To use a generic class or method, you specify the actual type when you instantiate it. For example:

Code snippet
MyGenericClass<string> myStringClass = new MyGenericClass<string>();
Use code with caution. Learn more
In this example, the T type parameter is replaced with the string type.

Uses and applications of generics in C#
Generics can be used in a variety of situations in C#. Some common uses include:

Creating generic collections
Creating generic methods that can work with any type of data
Creating generic interfaces that can be implemented by classes of any type
Generics can help to improve the readability, maintainability, and performance of your code. 
They can also help to prevent errors caused by incompatible types.

Code samples
Here are some code samples that demonstrate how to use generics in C#:

Generic class

Code snippet
class MyGenericClass<T>
{
    public T Value { get; set; }

    public MyGenericClass(T value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
Generic method

Code snippet
public T MyGenericMethod<T>(T value)
{
    return value;
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
Usage

Code snippet
MyGenericClass<string> myStringClass = new MyGenericClass<string>("Hello, world!");

string value = myStringClass.Value;

Console.WriteLine(value); // Prints "Hello, world!"

MyGenericMethod<int>(5); // Returns 5

Generics in C# are a feature that allows you to write classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with any type of data.
They are used to create reusable and type-safe code, which helps to reduce bugs and improve code quality. 
Generics are also known as parameterized types or templates in some programming languages like C++ levelup.gitconnected.com.

To create a generic class in C#, you use angle brackets <> and a type parameter, usually denoted with the letter 'T'. Heres a simple example of a generic class:

public class GenericClass<T>
{
    private T data;

    public void SetData(T value)
    {
        data = value;
    }

    public T GetData()
    {
        return data;
    }
}
In this example, the GenericClass has a type parameter 'T', which can be any type. 
The SetData and GetData methods work with this type parameter, allowing you to store and retrieve data of any type.

To use the generic class, you specify the desired type when creating an instance:

GenericClass<int> intInstance = new GenericClass<int>();
intInstance.SetData(42);
int intValue = intInstance.GetData();

GenericClass<string> stringInstance = new GenericClass<string>();
stringInstance.SetData("Hello, world!");
string stringValue = stringInstance.GetData();
In this example, we created two instances of the GenericClass, one for integers and one for strings.
The type parameter 'T' is replaced with the specified type (int or string) in each instance.

Generics can also be used in methods. Heres an example of a generic method that swaps the values of two variables:

public static void Swap<T>(ref T a, ref T b)
{
    T temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
To use the Swap method, you can call it with any type of variables:

int x = 10;
int y = 20;
Swap(ref x, ref y); // x becomes 20, y becomes 10

string s1 = "Hello";
string s2 = "World";
Swap(ref s1, ref s2); // s1 becomes "World", s2 becomes "Hello"

Generics are useful in various scenarios, such as creating reusable data structures (like lists, dictionaries, and queues) and 
implementing algorithms that can work with any type of data. They help to improve code reusability, reduce code duplication,
and increase type safety, making the code less prone to errors

  In C#, generics provide a way to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with different data types while 
maintaining type safety. They allow you to write reusable code that is not tied to a specific data type, increasing code flexibility and reducing code duplication.

To create a generic class in C#, you use the class keyword followed by the name of the class and the generic type parameter(s) enclosed in angle brackets.
Heres an example of a generic class called Stack<T> that represents a stack data structure:


class Stack<T>
{
    private List<T> items = new List<T>();

    public void Push(T item)
    {
        items.Add(item);
    }

    public T Pop()
    {
        if (items.Count == 0)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("The stack is empty.");

        T item = items[items.Count - 1];
        items.RemoveAt(items.Count - 1);
        return item;
    }
}
In the above code, we define a generic class Stack<T> that uses a generic type parameter T.
The class has a private field items of type List<T> to store the stack items. It provides methods Push() and Pop() to add and remove items from the stack.

You can use the generic class Stack<T> with different data types when creating instances. 
Heres an example:


Stack<int> intStack = new Stack<int>();
intStack.Push(10);
intStack.Push(20);
intStack.Push(30);

int poppedItem = intStack.Pop();   // Pops 30 from the stack
Console.WriteLine(poppedItem);    // Output: 30

Stack<string> stringStack = new Stack<string>();
stringStack.Push("Hello");
stringStack.Push("World");

string poppedString = stringStack.Pop();   // Pops "World" from the stack
Console.WriteLine(poppedString);          // Output: World
In the above code, we create instances of the generic class Stack<T> with different data types (int and string).
We use the Push() method to add items to the stack and the Pop() method to remove items from the stack.

Generics are widely used in C# and have various applications:

Reusability: Generics allow you to write reusable code that can work with different data types. 
This reduces code duplication and increases code maintainability.

Type Safety: Generics provide type safety, ensuring that you can only use the appropriate data types with the generic class or method. 
The compiler performs type checking at compile-time, preventing type-related errors.

Collections and Data Structures: Generics are extensively used in collections and data structures provided
by the .NET Framework, such as List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, and Queue<T>. They allow you to create strongly-typed collections
that can store and retrieve elements of specific data types.

Algorithms and Data Processing: Generics are beneficial when implementing algorithms or data processing logic that needs to handle 
different data types. It enables you to write generic algorithms that can be applied to various data types, improving code reusability and flexibility.

Generics provide a powerful feature in C# for writing reusable and type-safe code that can work with different data types. 
They are widely used in various aspects of C# programming, including collections, algorithms, data structures, and libraries,
to enhance code flexibility, maintainability, and performance.

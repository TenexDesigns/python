Method overriding in Python is a concept where a subclass (child class) provides a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass(parent class).
When a method is called on an object of the subclass, the overridden method in the subclass will be called instead of the one in the superclass.

Heres an example of how method overriding works in Python:
  To overide a method of the parent class in the child class, Enusure that you write that method of the parent class to have the same signature(Same parameters) in the child class




class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")

animal = Animal()
animal.speak()   # Output: Animal speaks

dog = Dog()
dog.speak()   # Output: Dog barks





In the above code, we have defined two classes Animal and Dog. The Animal class has a method called speak() which prints "Animal speaks".
The Dog class inherits from the Animal class and overrides the speak() method with its own implementation that prints "Dog barks".

When we create an object of the Animal class and call the speak() method, it will print "Animal speaks".
But when we create an object of the Dog class and call the speak() method, it will print "Dog barks" instead of "Animal speaks". 
This is because the Dog class has overridden the speak() method of the Animal class.

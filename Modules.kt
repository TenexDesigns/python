Module - Is a file containing code that you want to include in your program
         Use 'import ' to include a module
         A module can be built-in or you can create your own
         Modules are useful to break up a large program into reusable searate files.



To know different built in modules in python
run the below code

print(help("modules"))


To know more about a module 

print(help("math"))


To  include a module in your program use import moduleNamme


Import "math"

In Python, a module is a file that contains Python definitions and statements.
Modules can be used to organize code into logical groups, which can then be easily imported and used in other Python programs.
Python modules can define functions, classes, and variables, and can also include runnable code.

To use a module in a Python program, you need to first import it using the import statement. Here's an example:


import math

print(math.pi)



In this example, we're importing the math module and then using the pi constant that's defined in it.

You can also import specific functions or variables from a module using the from keyword. For example:



from math import sqrt

print(sqrt(25))



In this example, we're importing only the sqrt function from the math module.

Python also comes with a number of built-in modules that provide useful functionality, such as os for operating system-related tasks,
sys for interacting with the Python interpreter, and random for generating random numbers.

You can also create your own modules by defining functions, classes, and variables in a Python file and then importing them in other Python programs.
To import a module from a file in the same directory as your program, you can simply use the filename without the .py extension. For example:



# my_module.py

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")




# main.py

import my_module

my_module.greet("Alice")








In this example, we're importing the greet function from the my_module module and using it to greet the user "Alice".

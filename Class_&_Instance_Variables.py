In Python classes, instance variables and class variables are two different types of variables that can be defined.




Instance Varaiables

Instance variables are variables that are unique to each instance of a class.
They are defined in the constructor method __init__ and are accessed through the instance of the class. Here's an example:





class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # instance variable
        self.age = age  # instance variable

person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice
print(person2.age)  # Output: 25


In this example, name and age are instance variables.
They are unique to each instance of the Person class. 
When we create a new Person object, we pass in the values for name and age as arguments to the constructor method __init__.
The values are stored as instance variables.





Class varaiables


Class variables, on the other hand, are variables that are shared by all instances of a class. 
They are defined outside of any method of the class and are accessed through the class itself. Here's an example:


class Person:
    count = 3  # class variable

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # instance variable
        self.age = age  # instance variable

person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

print(Person.count)  # Output: 3
print(Person1.count)  # Output: 3
print(Person2.count)  # Output: 3


How ever remebert  That when we alter the Person Class count , It will change the result for all instances of the person class


Person.count = 4


print(Person.count)  # Output: 4
print(Person1.count)  # Output: 4
print(Person2.count)  # Output: 4


Howe ever if we change an individual instance of the class ,Only that instance will be affeted

person1.count = 9



print(Person.count)  # Output: 4
print(Person1.count)  # Output: 9
print(Person2.count)  # Output: 4

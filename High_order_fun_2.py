In Python, a higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as its result.
Higher-order functions are an essential concept in functional programming and are widely used in Python.

Here are some examples of higher-order functions in Python:

map() function:
The map() function takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns an iterator that applies the function to each element of the iterable.
Heres an example:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)
print(list(squared_numbers))  # prints [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


In this example, the map() function takes the square() function and the numbers list as arguments and applies the square() function to each element of the list.

filter() function:
The filter() function takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns an iterator that contains the elements of the iterable for which the function returns True.
Heres an example:


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

even_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers)
print(list(even_numbers))  # prints [2, 4]




In this example, the filter() function takes the is_even() function and the numbers list as arguments and returns an iterator that contains only the even numbers from the list.

reduce() function:
The reduce() function takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns a single value that results from applying the function cumulatively to the items of the iterable.
Heres an example:


from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

product = reduce(multiply, numbers)
print(product)  # prints 120




In this example, the reduce() function takes the multiply() function and the numbers list as arguments and returns the product of all the numbers in the list.

Overall, higher-order functions in Python are a powerful tool for functional programming and can help make your code more concise and expressive.

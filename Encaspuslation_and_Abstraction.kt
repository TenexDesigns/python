Encapsulation and Abstraction are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming.
They help to manage complexity, maintainability, and reusability of code.

Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together into a single unit, typically a class. 
Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details and protects data from being accessed or modified by external code.
This is achieved by using access specifiers such as public, private, protected, and internal (c-sharpcorner.com, geeksforgeeks.org).

Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by focusing on relevant information and hiding unnecessary details.
It allows developers to work with high-level concepts without worrying about low-level implementation details.
Classes and interfaces in C# are examples of abstraction (tutlane.com).

Heres a brief explanation of each access specifier:

public: Members with this access level can be accessed from any code.
private: Members with this access level can only be accessed within the same class.
protected: Members with this access level can be accessed within the same class and its derived classes.
internal: Members with this access level can be accessed within the same assembly.
protected internal: Members with this access level can be accessed within the same assembly and derived classes in any assembly (tutlane.com).

Encapsulation and abstraction are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Encapsulation is the process of wrapping up data and methods into a single unit, called a class. Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the functionality that is needed by the user.

Access specifiers are used to control the access to members of a class. There are four access specifiers in C#:

Public: Members with public access can be accessed from anywhere.
Private: Members with private access can only be accessed within the class in which they are declared.
Protected: Members with protected access can be accessed from within the class in which they are declared and from classes that inherit from that class.
Internal: Members with internal access can be accessed from within the assembly in which they are declared.
GET and SET methods are used to get and set the value of a private member. GET methods are used to get the value of a private member, while SET methods are used to set the value of a private member.

Here is an example of a class that uses encapsulation and abstraction:

C#
public class Car
{
    private int _make;
    private int _model;
    private int _year;

    public int Make
    {
        get { return _make; }
        set { _make = value; }
    }

    public int Model
    {
        get { return _model; }
        set { _model = value; }
    }

    public int Year
    {
        get { return _year; }
        set { _year = value; }
    }

    public Car(int make, int model, int year)
    {
        _make = make;
        _model = model;
        _year = year;
    }

    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The car is driving.");
    }
}

This class has three private members: _make, _model, and _year. These members are not accessible outside of the class. The class also has three public members: Make, Model, and Year. These members can be accessed from outside of the class. The class also has a public method called Drive. This method can be used to drive the car.

Encapsulation and abstraction are important concepts in OOP. They can be used to improve the readability, maintainability, and security of your code.

Here are some of the uses and applications of encapsulation and abstraction in C#:

Encapsulation can be used to hide the implementation details of a class, making it easier to maintain and update the class.
Abstraction can be used to provide a simplified view of a complex object, making it easier for users to interact with the object.
Encapsulation and abstraction can be used to improve the security of your code by preventing users from accessing sensitive data or methods.
Encapsulation and abstraction are powerful tools that can be used to improve the quality of your C# code.

Encapsulation and Abstraction, together with Access Specifiers, form the foundation of object-oriented programming in C#.

Encapsulation is a mechanism that combines data and methods (or functions) into a single unit called a class.
It helps in hiding the internal details of an object and providing a controlled way to access and manipulate the objects data.
Encapsulation allows you to achieve data abstraction, data hiding, and data protection.

Abstraction is the process of representing complex real-world entities in a simplified manner. 
It involves focusing on the essential characteristics of an object while hiding unnecessary details. 
Abstraction allows you to define the structure and behavior of objects through classes, interfaces, and abstract classes, without exposing their internal implementation.

Access Specifiers define the accessibility of classes, members (fields, properties, methods), 
and other elements in C#. They control how these elements can be accessed or used by other parts of the program. C# provides several access specifiers:

Public: The public access specifier allows the element to be accessed from anywhere in the program, including outside the class or assembly.

Private: The private access specifier restricts the elements accessibility to within the same class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

Protected: The protected access specifier allows the element to be accessed within the same class or by derived classes(, a derived class, 
also known as a subclass or child class, is a class that inherits properties, methods, and other members from a base class or parent class.)
  It is not accessible from outside the class or assembly.

Internal: The internal access specifier allows the element to be accessed within the same assembly (or project).
  It is not accessible from outside the assembly.

Protected Internal: The protected internal access specifier combines the behavior of both protected and internal. 
  It allows the element to be accessed within the same assembly or by derived classes, even in other assemblies.

Now, lets discuss the get and set methods, also known as accessors, which are used to implement properties in C#.

Properties provide a way to encapsulate fields (data) within a class and control access to them.
Properties typically have a get method to retrieve the value of the property and a set method to assign a new value to the property.

Heres an example of a class with a property:


class Person
{
    private string name;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }
}

In the above code, we define a Person class with a private field name. 
The Name property has a get method that returns the value of name and a set method that assigns a new value to name.

We can use this property to access and modify the name field of an instance of the Person class:


Person person = new Person();
person.Name = "John";   // Set the value of the Name property
string name = person.Name;   // Get the value of the Name property
Console.WriteLine(name);   // Output: John
In the above code, we create an instance of the Person class and use the Name property to set and get the value of the name field.

The get and set methods provide control over the access and modification of data within a class. 
They allow you to perform additional logic or validation before getting or setting the value of a property.
You can add conditions, perform calculations, or trigger events within these methods.

Properties are widely used in C# for encapsulating fields, implementing data validation, providing controlled access to data,
and maintaining the principle of encapsulation.

In summary, encapsulation and abstraction help in organizing and managing code by combining related data and functionality
while hiding unnecessary details. Access specifiers define the accessibility of classes and members, controlling their visibility and usage. 
The get and set methods, or accessors, are used to create properties and provide controlled access to encapsulated data.



















KEYWORDS EXPLAINED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Sure! Here are explanations of some key terms used in C#:

Assembly: An assembly is a compiled unit of code in C#. It contains the compiled code, metadata,
and resources required to execute an application or library. An assembly can be an executable file
(with the .exe extension) or a dynamic link library (with the .dll extension).

Namespace: A namespace is a way to organize and group related classes, interfaces, and other types in C#.
It provides a hierarchical naming structure to avoid naming conflicts. Namespaces help in organizing code and provide a logical separation of functionality.

Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects in C#. It defines the structure and behavior of 
objects by specifying their properties, methods, events, and other members. Classes are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming.

Method: A method is a block of code that performs a specific task or action in C#. It contains a series of 
statements that are executed when the method is called. Methods can have parameters to accept inputs and can return values.
They are used to encapsulate reusable code and promote code modularity.

Member: In C#, a member refers to any element defined within a class or struct. It can be a field (variable), property, method, 
event, or nested type. Members define the characteristics and behavior of objects created from the class.

Object: An object is an instance of a class in C#. It represents a specific entity with its own state and behavior.
Objects are created using the new keyword and can access the members defined within their class.

Constructor: A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
It initializes the objects state and performs any necessary setup operations. Constructors have the same name as the class and can have parameters.

Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows one class to derive properties and behavior from another class.
The derived class (subclass) inherits the members of the base class (superclass) and can extend or modify them. 
Inheritance promotes code reuse and supports the concept of "is-a" relationships.

Interface: An interface defines a contract of methods, properties, events, or indexers that a class must implement.
It provides a way to achieve multiple inheritance in C#. A class can implement one or more interfaces, which enforce a certain behavior or functionality.

Derived class :A derived class, also known as a subclass or child class, is a class that inherits properties, 
methods, and other members from a base class or parent class.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
In C#, polymorphism is achieved through inheritance and interfaces.
It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type, enabling code flexibility and extensibility.

These are some of the fundamental terms used in C# programming. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively designing and implementing C# applications.

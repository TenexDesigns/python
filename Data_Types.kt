In Python, there are several built-in data types available. Here are some of the most commonly used data types:



1.Integer (int): 
This data type is used to represent whole numbers, both positive and negative.

2.Floating-point number (float):
This data type is used to represent decimal numbers.

3.String (str): 
This data type is used to represent text or a sequence of characters.

4.Boolean (bool):
This data type is used to represent true or false values.

5.List (list): 
This data type is used to represent an ordered collection of items, which can be of different data types.

6.Tuple (tuple):
This data type is used to represent an ordered, immutable collection of items, which can be of different data types.

7.Set (set):
This data type is used to represent an unordered collection of unique items.

8.Dictionary (dict):
This data type is used to represent a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.

Python also allows you to define your own data types using classes and objects. Additionally, you can use third-party libraries to work with specialized data types like arrays,
matrices, and graphs.

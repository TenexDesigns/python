In C#, a queue is a collection that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is used to store and retrieve elements
in the order they were added. The Queue<T> class in C# provides functionality to create and manipulate queues.
Heres an explanation of queues in C# with code samples:

Creating a Queue:

To create a queue, you need to instantiate the Queue<T> class by specifying the type of elements it will store. Heres an example:


Queue<string> queue = new Queue<string>();
In the above code, a queue of type string is created.

Adding Elements to a Queue:

You can add elements to a queue using the Enqueue method. It adds the element to the end of the queue. Heres an example:


queue.Enqueue("Apple");
queue.Enqueue("Banana");
queue.Enqueue("Orange");

In the above code, the Enqueue method is used to add three strings to the queue.

Retrieving and Removing Elements from a Queue:

To retrieve and remove elements from a queue, you use the Dequeue method.
It returns the element at the beginning of the queue and removes it. Heres an example:


string firstElement = queue.Dequeue();
Console.WriteLine(firstElement);  // Output: "Apple"
In the above code, the Dequeue method is used to retrieve and remove the first element from the queue.

Peeking at the First Element:

To peek at the first element of the queue without removing it, you use the Peek method. 
It returns the element at the beginning of the queue without modifying the queue. Heres an example:


string firstElement = queue.Peek();
Console.WriteLine(firstElement);  // Output: "Banana"
In the above code, the Peek method is used to retrieve the first element from the queue without removing it.

Checking the Count of Elements:

You can check the number of elements in a queue using the Count property. Heres an example:


int count = queue.Count;
Console.WriteLine(count);  // Output: 2
In the above code, the Count property is used to get the number of elements in the queue.

Checking if a Queue Contains an Element:

You can check if a queue contains a specific element using the Contains method.
It returns true if the element is found in the queue, otherwise false. Heres an example:


bool containsBanana = queue.Contains("Banana");
Console.WriteLine(containsBanana);  // Output: true
In the above code, the Contains method is used to check if the queue contains the string "Banana".

Queues are commonly used in scenarios where elements need to be processed in the order they were added.
They are often used in algorithms, simulations, and event-driven programming.

A queue is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements and operates on first in first out (FIFO) algorithm. Here's how to implement a queue in C#:

Creating a Queue

To create a queue, use the Queue<T> class in C#. Here's an example:

Queue<int> myQueue = new Queue<int>();
This creates an empty queue of integers.

Enqueue and Dequeue Operations

To add an item to the queue, use the Enqueue() method:

myQueue.Enqueue(10);
This adds the integer 10 to the queue.

To remove an item from the queue, use the Dequeue() method:

int firstItem = myQueue.Dequeue();
This removes the first item from the queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, a InvalidOperationException is thrown.

Peek Operation

To get the first item in the queue without removing it, use the Peek() method:

int firstItem = myQueue.Peek();
This returns the first item in the queue. If the queue is empty, a InvalidOperationException is thrown.

Count Property

To get the number of items in the queue, use the Count property:

int count = myQueue.Count;
This returns the number of items in the queue.

Here is an example of how to use the Queue<T> class:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Queue<int> myQueue = new Queue<int>();

        myQueue.Enqueue(10);
        myQueue.Enqueue(20);
        myQueue.Enqueue(30);

        Console.WriteLine("First item: {0}", myQueue.Peek());

        int firstItem = myQueue.Dequeue();
        Console.WriteLine("Removed item: {0}", firstItem);

        Console.WriteLine("Remaining items:");
        foreach (int item in myQueue)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
    }
}
This outputs:

First item: 10
Removed item: 10
Remaining items:
20
30
